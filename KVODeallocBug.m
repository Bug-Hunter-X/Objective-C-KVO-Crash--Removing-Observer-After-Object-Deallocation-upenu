This bug occurs when using KVO (Key-Value Observing) in Objective-C.  The issue arises when an object is deallocated while it's still being observed.  This can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior.  Specifically, if you remove an observer *after* the observed object has been deallocated, a crash is likely.  Another subtle point is that if the observer is on a background thread, and the observed object is deallocated on the main thread, the KVO mechanism might not gracefully handle this timing issue.
